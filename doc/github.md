To set up a GitHub repository to serve as an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) repository for Yandex Cloud using Terraform, follow these steps:

Initialize the Repository:
* Create a new directory for the project.
* Initialize a new Git repository.
* Set up the directory structure for the Terraform code and environment variables.

Write Terraform Configuration:
* Create the necessary Terraform configuration files in the terraform/ directory.

Create a TFVARS File:
* Create an environment-specific TFVARS file to store variable values.

Set Up GitHub Actions Pipeline:
* Create a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the deployment of your Terraform code.

GitHub Actions workflow automates the deployment of the Terraform code. Save this as `.github/workflows/terraform.yml`

# Setup environment

Go to GitHub repository.

Navigate to Settings -> Code and automation -> Environments and add an environment:
* name: DEV

Add environment secrets:
* YC_OAUTH_TOKEN: Yandex Cloud OAuth token (y0_AgAA***1KHA).
* CLOUD_ID: Yandex Cloud ID (b1gbs***).
* FOLDER_ID: Yandex Folder ID (b1grha***).

The action workflow pipeline is triggered on commit in `main` branch.
